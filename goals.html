	<h1>The Goals</h1>
	<p>This is an unordered, unfinished and changing list of things I want in my life in the next five years. This list is to keep me motivated through the coming months.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I need to be self reliant. I need an income that can satisfy my wants. I need my technical skills to be the reason I can provide for myself.</li>
	<li>I want a big office. A space for work and game.</li>
	<li>I want to live in a city that is homely. With space to walk around and not have to drive everywhere. That is acceptable for pets also.</li>
	<li>I want my life to involve lots of tech! I love exporing and trying new tech and devices and is part of the reason I wanted to get involved with software developement to begin with.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
