	<h2 class='attention-voice'>Strong public transportation options stimulate the economy</h2>

	<p class='calm-voice'>When high-speed rail is done right, it pulls cities closer together in ways that are difficult to ignore. The speed at which space-age trains can travel and the lack of traffic to contend with mean that commutes are often half of what it would take to drive the same distance. Better still, far less carbon is emitted, less space needs to be allocated to parking, and poorer residents, who are less likely to own cars, are able to travel. Strong public transportation options stimulate the economy by connecting employers with broader pools of workers and vice-versa and lift the value of properties located near stations.</p>
