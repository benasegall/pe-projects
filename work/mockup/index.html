			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<img class="reg-img" src="images/method.jpeg" alt="This is a mind map diagram">
			<p>There are five main sects of process for my methodology when using code to create a project. <span>First</span>, is to determine the requirements of the project. <span>Second</span>, is to analyze the bounds of the project, assigned to me by the original design wireframe, or inspiration for the final outcome. <span>Third</span>, is to begin development of the design present, or continue to iterate on the design before preceding to; <span>Fourth</span>, making sketches with code. Formatting the project using sections, or dividers to be filled in with data later. <span>Fifth</span>, testing. Ensuring the code, filled in with all data is properly functioning, if it is not then go back to step four and continue until the process is complete.</p>

			<h2>What it means to work with tech and code.</h2>
			<p>To me, working with tech and code is a way to direct my creativity into design. It's a tool that allows me to bring my ideas to life in a tangible way. There are many sides to tech, and coding offers a way to tap into its potential for creativity. For me, the goal of working with code is to create designs that are visually pleasing, communicate a message, and achieve the intended goals of the project. It requires a combination of technical knowledge, artistic vision, and problem-solving skills. Overall, working with tech and code is an exciting opportunity to innovate and solve problems.</p>
