		<h1>Case Study</h1>

			<h2>Design Problem</h2>
			<p>The Calculator from Apple is a minimal app that allows users to commit calculations and receive fast results easily. With a few updates, this app could help users solve more problems more efficiently. One feature that could massively improve user interaction with this app is a solution history.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>User Persona</h2>
			<p>The ideal customer is a woman named Alex. Alex is in their early 20’s and lives with 2 roommates. She is a prospective university student and works part-time. Alex lives in Sacramento, is familiar with productivity gadgets and is passionate about efficiency and practicality.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
			<p>As a busy part-time employee and university student, Alex doesn't like wasting time. She needs an easy way to calculate solutions to simple math problems, like adding up her utility bills or dividing her rent between her and her roommates. The current calculator app installed on her phone makes it easy to solve problems but it is difficult for her to recall one solution after another, and it is too time-consuming to write it all down on paper.</p>
			<p>What the calculator app needs to serve Alex’s needs is a solution history, with this feature she can stop wasting her time documenting solution results, as this would take place in the app automatically. With the results ready for her to re-enter them into the next calculation.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Solution Hypothesis</h2>
			<p>How would a solution history feature improve user interaction with the Calculator?
			A significant issue users experience using the Calculator is that there is no in-app system to store previous calculation outputs. When computing systems of equations, human memory is unreliable. This is why it is needed to implement a solution history feature. This feature would allow users to track previously computed outputs and reuse them in new computations.</p>

			<h2>Challenges I faced</h2>
			<p>The obvious design issue is where to place this new feature. Like many Apple products, the Calculator looks complete, like everything present on the app is meant to be there, and anything that is not present isn’t. However, upon inspection it became clear what the solution was, and where to place the new feature.</p>

			<img class="small-img" src="images/ex-3.png" alt="This is an image which displays 3 of 3 trials that did not make it to experimentation.">
			<img class="small-img" src="images/solution.png" alt="This is an image which displays where I figured to insert my solution.">
			<p>The solution is to integrate the additional feature within the original layout. By applying the same design of all other buttons to the zero button, there becomes an available space, without disrupting the current flow of the app design.</p>

			<h2>Solution Experiments</h2>

		<section>
			<h2>How my solution solves the problem</h2>
			<p>As demonstrated, a solution history feature allows users to track previously computed outputs for easy reuse in new computations. Reducing user frustration, improving efficiency, ease of use, and overall product experience.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
			<p>With a solution history feature, users are more enabled than ever to solve problems using the Calculator app. Without the need for non-in-app tools, like pen and paper. Users will be able to track and utilize computed equation results.</p>
