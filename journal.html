The Goal
My goal was the design a website that would be typical of a Dermatologist office or a MediSpa.

Design Process
First I made a rough edit of what I thought I wanted to make based on the other businesses websites linked to me from the owners of the business. I made this in Affinity. 
I opened my code editor and saved my HTML and CSS files and got to work.
I first coded out the layout of the page before adding any images or text. Like sections, header and footer links, etc
Then to the CSS I did the same thing with laying out what I thought I might need to add properties too
Then it was a matter of googling and remembering how to do the stuff I wanted
