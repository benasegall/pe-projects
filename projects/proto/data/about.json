            "info": "My high school and college years set the footing for my career path. In high school I enrolled myself in a graphic design program at a vocational training school. This was my first experience in a design field. Later on I took courses at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. In college I pursued a marketing degree but was not fully connected with this field of study."

            "info": "Once the pandemic hit, I decided to take a leave of absence from school and moved to New York. There I discovered Codesmith and took their Computer Science prep course. This was my first significant experience with software development. After this, I decided instead of returning to campus I would pursue a different route and was accepted into the design oriented software development mentorship program at Perpetual Education."
