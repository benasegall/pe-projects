			<p>Iâ€™m a front-end developer based on the East Coast. I care about creating semantic, clean code and maintainable CSS with lots of explanatory notes. I also like JavaScript.</p>
			<p>It\'s important to me that I have a full view of the development process, while I have a growing understanding of the back-end my passion is for design and presentation.</p>
			<p>I\'m currently under mentorship at Perpetual Education. Honing my professional skills and learning about the design and development process from idea to implementation.</p>
